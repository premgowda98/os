## 📘 Notes: Difference Between Adding to PATH vs Registering in Registry (Windows)

### ✅ 1. **Adding a Program to the PATH Environment Variable**

#### 🔹 Purpose:

* Allows you to run executables from **any terminal** without needing to specify the full path.

#### 🔹 How:

* Add the folder containing the `.exe` to the `PATH` environment variable:

  ```batch
  set PATH=%PATH%;C:\MyTools
  ```

#### 🔹 Scope:

* Affects only **command-line access**.
* Doesn't make Windows treat the program as officially “installed”.

#### 🔹 Use Cases:

* Developer tools (e.g., `go`, `python`, `git`)
* Scripts and CLI utilities

#### 🔹 Limitations:

* Won’t appear in **Programs & Features**.
* Can’t be easily uninstalled through the Control Panel or Settings.
* No version info or metadata stored.

### ✅ 2. **Installing a Program via Registry Entries**

#### 🔹 Purpose:

* Makes the program **officially recognized by Windows**.
* Adds it to:

  * **Programs & Features** (Control Panel)
  * **Apps & Features** (Windows Settings)
  * **Software uninstallers**

#### 🔹 How:

* Installer writes values to the Windows Registry under:

  ```
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall
  ```

  or

  ```
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall
  ```

#### 🔹 Typical Values Stored:

* DisplayName (e.g., "MyApp")
* DisplayVersion
* Publisher
* InstallLocation
* UninstallString (e.g., `uninstall.exe`)

#### 🔹 Use Cases:

* Applications intended for end users
* Apps that need version tracking, auto-updating, or clean uninstall support

### 💡 Summary

* **PATH** = Makes `.exe` callable from terminal — good for lightweight tools.
* **Registry Install** = Makes the app look “installed” to Windows — ideal for full applications.
* You can (and often should) do **both** for apps with a CLI and GUI.
